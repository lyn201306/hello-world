# hello-world

Hi, everyone!
I am a new guy on gitHub, I just graduated from university and I hope i can get a good job!
I want to study the web programming(front-end).
I know little about web programming, only some basic separated knowlege which i studied at school.

Second time using gitHub, after interview with the employer, I recognize that my basic knowledge is so weak, I still got a lot of things to learn.
